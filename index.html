  <h1 class="info">Whispering woods</h1>
  <p class="lin" >Deep within the heart of the Whispering Woods, a place shrouded in mist
    and mystery, lived a young girl named Elara. Unlike other children in her
    village, Elara was fearless. She had heard the stories—the warnings about
    the ancient forest where the trees seemed to talk and shadows moved on
    their own. But to Elara, the woods were a place of wonder, not fear. One
    crisp autumn morning, Elara decided to explore the uncharted parts of the
    forest, far beyond where anyone dared to go. As she wandered deeper, the
    trees grew taller, their branches twisted like ancient hands reaching for
    the sky. The air was filled with an eerie hum, like a song sung by the
    wind. Elara listened closely, and she realized it wasn't the wind at
    all—the trees were whispering. "Welcome, brave one," they seemed to say.
    Elara, her heart racing with a mixture of excitement and unease, continued
    onward. She stumbled upon a clearing bathed in soft, golden light. In the
    center stood a massive, ancient oak, its trunk adorned with symbols and
    runes that glowed faintly. Elara approached, her fingers grazing the rough
    bark. Suddenly, the whispers grew louder, urgent. "Find the heart, save
    the woods," the voices echoed. Elara noticed a small hollow at the base of
    the oak, and inside, a glowing stone pulsated like a heartbeat. She
    carefully removed it, feeling a surge of warmth spread through her.
    Instantly, the forest seemed to breathe easier; the mist lifted, and the
    oppressive shadows faded. With the heart in her hands, Elara knew the
    forest’s secret. She had been chosen as its guardian. From that day
    forward, the Whispering Woods were no longer a place of fear, but of magic
    and harmony, forever protected by the brave girl who dared to listen.</p>
